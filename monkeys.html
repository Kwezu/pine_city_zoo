                       <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                 <p>Monkeys are intelligent, social primates belonging to the order <em>Primates</em> and are found across Africa, Asia, Central and South America. They are divided into two major groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in the Americas). Unlike apes, monkeys typically have tails and are generally smaller in size. They live in a wide variety of habitats including tropical rainforests, savannahs, mountains, and even urban areas.</p>

<p>Monkeys have many distinctive features. They are known for their dexterous hands, expressive faces, sharp eyesight, and incredible agility. Many species live in complex social groups and use vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to communicate. Some monkeys, like capuchins and macaques, are known for their intelligence and ability to use tools, solve puzzles, and learn behaviors by watching others.</p>

<p>Monkeys are omnivores and their diet usually includes fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, insects, and small animals. Their strong limbs and prehensile tails (in New World species) help them swing through trees or move quickly on the ground. Monkeys are active during the day and spend much of their time grooming each other, foraging for food, or playingn especially the younger ones.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the monkeys at pen M09, located near the canopy walk bridge and tropical forest trail.</p>
