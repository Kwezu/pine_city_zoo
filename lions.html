                       <h3>LIONS</h3>
                   <p>Lions are powerful carnivorous mammals known as the kings of the jungle, though they typically inhabit savannahs and grasslands. They belong to the species <em>Panthera leo</em> and are part of the big cat family, Felidae. Native to Africa and a small region in India (the Gir Forest), lions are the only truly social cats, living in groups called prides. A pride usually consists of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males.</p>

<p>Lions have many distinctive features. Males are easily recognised by their large manes, which range in color from blond to black and give them a majestic appearance. Females, or lionesses, do most of the hunting and are slightly smaller and more agile. Lions have muscular bodies, strong jaws, and sharp claws designed for taking down large prey such as zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes. Their deep roar, which can be heard up to 8 km (5 miles) away, is used to communicate and defend territory.</p>

<p>Lions are carnivores and typically hunt in coordinated groups, using teamwork to stalk and ambush their prey. They spend a large portion of the day resting up to 20 hours especially during the heat. Lions play a crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators, helping to regulate prey populations and maintain balance in the wild.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen B01, near the big cat lookout platform and across from the predator zone exhibit.</p>
