                       <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                      <p>Gemsbok are large antelopes of the genus *Oryx*, native to arid regions of Southern Africa. The most well-known species is the gemsbok (*Oryx gazella*), renowned for its striking appearance, long straight horns, and ability to thrive in harsh desert environments. These antelopes are commonly found in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa, particularly in dry savannahs and semi-desert regions like the Kalahari. Gemsbok belong to the Bovidae family and are well-adapted to life in water-scarce areas, able to survive extreme heat and dryness.</p>

<p>Gemsbok have several distinctive features. They are easily recognised by their long, spear-like horns (present in both males and females), bold black-and-white facial markings, and muscular, sturdy bodies covered in light brown or greyish fur. Their horns are used for defense against predators and dominance displays during mating season. Their sharp eyesight and strong legs help them navigate vast open landscapes with speed and agility.</p>

<p>Gemsbok are herbivorous and feed primarily on grasses, roots, and tubers. They can go for long periods without water, obtaining moisture from their food and being mostly active during cooler parts of the day to conserve energy and avoid dehydration.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G14, located near the desert biome exhibit.</p>
