                       <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                      <p>Giraffes are the tallest land mammals on Earth, belonging to the genus <em>Giraffa</em> and the family Giraffidae. Native to various parts of sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes are easily recognisable by their exceptionally long necks and legs, as well as their distinctive spotted coat patterns, which vary between the different subspecies. These gentle giants are found in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands, where they roam in loose herds and feed on treetops.</p>

<p>Giraffes have many unique features. Their long necks, which can be up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) in length, allow them to reach leaves and shoots high in the trees that few other animals can access, particularly from acacia trees. They also have large eyes positioned on the sides of their heads, giving them excellent vision to spot predators from a distance. Their tongues are prehensile, measuring up to 45 cm (18 inches), and are specially adapted for grasping and stripping foliage. Giraffes move gracefully despite their size and can run at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph) over short distances.</p>

<p>Giraffes are herbivores and feed primarily on leaves, flowers, and fruits. They are ruminants, meaning they have a four-chambered stomach to help digest tough plant material. Although they get most of their water from food, giraffes will drink when water is available, often spreading their legs awkwardly to reach the ground.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G03, near the savannah viewing platform and watering hole exhibit.</p>
