                       <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family, scientifically known as <em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>. They are found across grasslands, savannahs, and lightly forested areas of sub Saharan Africa. Despite their rugged appearance, warthogs are social and surprisingly fast on their feet. They are well adapted to dry environments and are often seen grazing or trotting across open plains with their tails held upright like little flags.</p>

<p>Warthogs have several distinctive features. They are known for their large curved tusks, flat snouts, and facial "warts," which are thick skin pads that help protect their faces during fights. Their bodies are covered in sparse bristly hair, and they often have a mane running down their backs. Warthogs use their tusks for defense and for digging up roots or creating burrows. When threatened, they can run at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph).</p>

<p>Warthogs are omnivorous and feed mostly on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally insects or small animals. They often kneel on their front knees while grazing, thanks to special calloused pads on their legs. Warthogs commonly occupy burrows dug by other animals like aardvarks and will back into them to face outward for protection. They live in family groups called sounders, usually consisting of females and their young.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs at pen S06, near the savannah trail and across from the meerkat enclosure.</p>
