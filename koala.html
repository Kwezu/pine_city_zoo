                       <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, belonging to the species <em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em> and the family Phascolarctidae. Often called koala bears, they are not bears at all but are closely related to wombats and kangaroos. Koalas are found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia, where they spend most of their lives in the trees, rarely descending to the ground.</p>

<p>Koalas have several distinctive features, including a stout, tailless body, large fluffy ears, and a spoon shaped nose. They have strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing trees. Their thick, soft fur provides insulation and can range from grey to brown. Koalas are mostly nocturnal and sleep up to 18 to 22 hours a day to conserve energy, as their diet consists almost entirely of low-nutrition eucalyptus leaves.</p>

<p>Koalas are herbivores and highly selective eaters, feeding mainly on the leaves of certain eucalyptus species. They rarely drink water, as they get most of their hydration from the leaves they eat though they will drink during droughts or heatwaves. As marsupials, female koalas carry and nurse their young (called joeys) in a pouch for about six months after birth.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen A10, located near the Australian Outback exhibit and the eucalyptus grove.</p>
