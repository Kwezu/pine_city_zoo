                       <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                     <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth, belonging to the genus <em>Gorilla</em> and the family Hominidae. Native to the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) and the western gorilla (*Gorilla gorilla*), each with further subspecies. These powerful but gentle animals share around 98% of their DNA with humans and live in close-knit family groups led by a dominant silverback male.</p>

<p>Gorillas have several distinctive features, including broad chests, muscular arms, and expressive faces. Adult males develop a patch of silver hair on their backs, giving them the name silverbacks. They use facial expressions, body postures, and vocalizations to communicate with each other. Gorillas are mostly ground-dwelling and move using a method called knuckle-walking, although they can climb trees, especially younger or smaller individuals.</p>

<p>Gorillas are herbivorous and primarily eat leaves, stems, fruit, and shoots. They spend much of the day foraging and resting. Highly intelligent, gorillas have been observed using tools and showing emotions like joy, sadness, and affection. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect gorilla populations, which are threatened by habitat loss and poaching.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen P07, next to the tropical forest enclosure and primate center.</p>
