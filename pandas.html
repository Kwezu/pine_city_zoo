                       <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                 <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are iconic bear like mammals native to the mountain forests of central China. They belong to the species <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em> and are part of the bear family, Ursidae. Pandas are instantly recognisable by their striking black and white coats, gentle nature, and distinctive waddling gait. Once endangered, giant pandas are now considered vulnerable thanks to extensive conservation efforts.</p>

<p>Pandas have several distinctive features. They have strong jaws and large molar teeth adapted for crushing bamboo their primary food source. Their black patches around the eyes and ears are thought to aid in communication and camouflage. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have adapted to a mostly herbivorous diet. They spend much of their time eating and can consume up to 38 kg (84 lbs) of bamboo in a day. Pandas also have a unique, thumb-like wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo stalks with precision.</p>

<p>Giant pandas are solitary animals, usually active during the early morning and late afternoon. They communicate through scent markings, vocal sounds, and body language. Though they are excellent climbers and swimmers, they prefer to stay on the forest floor where bamboo is abundant. Pandas give birth to one or two cubs, but usually only one survives in the wild. Conservation programs and breeding centers play a critical role in ensuring their survival.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen C12, in the Asian forest enclosure next to the bamboo garden exhibit.</p>
